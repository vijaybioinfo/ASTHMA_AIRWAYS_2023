*Demultiplexing libraries*: Cell Ranger was used to demultiplex the 10x libraries.

*Demultiplexing donors*: Demuxlet was used to derive the cells' donor source.

*Quality control*: [An in-house script](https://github.com/vijaybioinfo/quality_control/blob/main/single_cell.R) was used to explore the quality of the data and select the thresholds.

*Clustering*: Seurat was used to cluster the data.
